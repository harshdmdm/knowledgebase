P05. Nebular Extinction
=======================

Observing Goals:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this project you will observe a nebula or edge-on galaxy and try to determine the extinction due to dust in the nebula or galaxy. 
Useful Background and References:

    * Osterbrock & Ferland 2005
    * R3. Line Emission from Narrow Band Observations

Observation Planning:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    * Expect HALF a night observing, either shift A or shift B.

    * Target Selection

        * Depending on your group, you should select either an edge on spiral galaxy or a nebula
        * Your target should be as high as possible in the sky (i.e. lowest airmass) for the duration of your observations
        * Your target should fit nicely within the frame of the CCD

    * Observations

        * Take images of your nebula in the Hβ, V, Hα, and R filters. 
        * Note that the Hβ filter images will need to be much longer than the other images
        * We strongly suggest that you take all of your images, including the calibration images (flat fields and bias frames), with the imaging CCD in 3⨯3 binning mode. (This reduces the resolution of your images but greatly improves the signal-to-noise.)

Data Analysis:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Data Reduction Basic Steps

        * Visit the page :ref:`data-reduction`
        * Register and combine your images for each filter
    * Further for this project

        * Create an H_alpha/H_beta image
        * To make it even more precise, you might want to first subtract the R-band image from the Hα image and the V-band image from the Hβ image.

    * Further Analysis for this project
        * Refer to this link for the flux knowledge https://blaauwobserverknowledgebase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pm/r03-narrow-lines.html
        * Compare the values of the H_a/H_b ratio across the image. In a fully calibrated image the ratio will be 2.74 in fully calibrated flux units in the case of emission from 10000K nebua with pure H and He ("case B recombination"; see Osterbrock & Ferland 2005). 
        * Any variation from this number means that there is extinction by dust in the nebula.

Results: 
^^^^^^^^

Can you answer these questions with your work?

    * Q1: Is there any variation in the ratio H_alpha/H_beta
    * Q2: If so, why? if not, why not?
